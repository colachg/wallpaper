# Wallpaper

A lightweight macOS menu bar app that sets your desktop wallpaper to the Bing daily image.

## Features

- Browse the last 10 days of Bing wallpapers
- UHD quality on all connected displays
- Locale-aware — fetches wallpapers matching your system language
- Auto-refresh every 6 hours
- Launch at login
- Auto-update

## Install

Download the latest `Wallpaper.app.zip` from [Releases](https://github.com/colachg/wallpaper/releases), unzip, and drag to `/Applications`.

Since the app is not signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS will block it on first launch. To open it:

1. Double-click `Wallpaper.app` — macOS will show a warning and refuse to open it
2. Go to **System Settings → Privacy & Security**, scroll down and click **Open Anyway**
3. Click **Open** in the confirmation dialog

You only need to do this once. After that, the app opens normally.

Requires macOS 15 (Sequoia) or later.
